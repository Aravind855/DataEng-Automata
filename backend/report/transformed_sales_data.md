# Sales Data Report

**File**: transformed_sales_data.csv
**Category**: Sales
**Database**: DataEng

**Schema**:
* customer_name (TEXT)
* revenue (INTEGER)
* invoice_id (TEXT)
* product (TEXT)
* date (TEXT)
* month (INTEGER)

**Shape**: 20 rows, 6 columns

**Data Profiling**:
* Total count of entries per column:
    * customer_name: 20
    * revenue: 20
    * invoice_id: 20
    * product: 20
    * date: 20
    * month: 20
* Unique value count per column:
    * customer_name: 20
    * revenue: 18
    * invoice_id: 20
    * product: 5
    * date: 20
    * month: 1
* Sum of null values across all columns: 0

**Primary Key**: invoice_id

**Missing Values**: None

**Anomalies**: No obvious anomalies detected (e.g., negative revenue values, duplicate invoice IDs).  Further analysis might involve outlier detection based on revenue using statistical methods (e.g., IQR or standard deviation).

**Feature Engineering Performed**:
The 'month' column appears to be derived from the 'date' column.  The 'date' column is likely a pre-processed version of a raw date field.

**Feature Engineering Suggestions**:
* Extract day of week from 'date' column.
* Create a new column for 'year' from the 'date' column.
* Consider creating aggregated metrics such as total revenue per product, average revenue per customer, or revenue per day.
* Analyze sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
