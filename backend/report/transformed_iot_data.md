**Total Null Count**: 0


**Primary Key**: sensor_id (Inferred)

**Missing Values**: None

**Anomalies**:

* No obvious negative values detected in numeric columns.
* No duplicate rows detected.
* Outliers might exist in the 'value' column. Further investigation with statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, IQR) is needed to confirm.


**Feature Engineering Performed**:

The 'hour_of_day' column appears to be derived from the 'timestamp' column.  This is a common feature engineering step for time series IoT data.


**Feature Engineering Suggestions**:

* **day_of_month**: Extract the day of the month from the 'timestamp' column.
* **day_of_week**: Extract the day of the week from the 'timestamp' column.
* **month**: Extract the month from the 'timestamp' column.
* **year**: Extract the year from the 'timestamp' column.
* **value_range**: Create categorical ranges for the 'value' column (e.g., low, medium, high) based on appropriate thresholds determined by the data distribution.  This could be particularly useful for visualizing or analyzing trends.
* **rolling_average**: Calculate a rolling average of the 'value' column for each sensor over a specific time window (e.g., 1-hour, 24-hour average). This would smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
