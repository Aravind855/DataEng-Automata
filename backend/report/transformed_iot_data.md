**Total Null Count**: 0


**Primary Key**: sensor_id (Inferred)

**Missing Values**: None

**Anomalies**:

* No obvious duplicate rows detected.
* No negative values found in numeric columns.
* Outlier analysis would require a more in-depth statistical analysis, considering the distribution of 'value' for each 'device_type'.  A simple IQR or standard deviation check isn't sufficient without understanding the expected ranges for temperature, humidity, and pressure.


**Feature Engineering Performed**:

The 'hour_of_day' column appears to be derived from the 'timestamp' column.


**Feature Engineering Suggestions**:

* **day_of_month**: Extract the day of the month from the 'timestamp' column.
* **day_of_week**: Extract the day of the week from the 'timestamp' column.
* **month**: Extract the month from the 'timestamp' column.
* **year**: Extract the year from the 'timestamp' column.
* **value_range**: Create categorical ranges for the 'value' column based on device type (e.g., low, medium, high temperature). This would require defining thresholds specific to each device type.
* **rolling_average**: Calculate a rolling average of the 'value' column for each sensor over a defined time window (e.g., 3-hour, 24-hour average).  This would require additional data points for a meaningful average.
